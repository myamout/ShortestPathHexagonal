# Weighted Graphs
A weighted graph is a group of nodes where each edge (line connecting each node) has a non-negative value (most of the time > 0). The edge is usually refered to as the cost to travel between the nodes. We want to find the path of edges that will give us the lowest cost. A quick Google search shows that Dijkstra's Algorithm is the best way to do it.

# Weighted Graph, Python 3
  - We'll need to implement a graph data structure
  - Our Graph data structure will hold node classes

# Algo
  1. Read in text file
  2. Build the hexagonal graph
  3. Apply algo

# Todo
  1. Start in bottom left corner
  2. Work our way to the top left corner
  3. Print out shortest cost path
